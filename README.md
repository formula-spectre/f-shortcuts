## Customization

### Automatic

You can define simple commands for FN keys in `~/.zsh-f-shortcuts.yaml` file. 

#### Structure

File should have two base keys:
1. `default_view` - default view to show.
2. `views` - list of defined views.

`views` section contains views you want to show. **Key is a view name.**

Under view name key you should define next keys:
1. `text` -  text that will show on touchbar key.
2. `command` or `view` - `command` means executing some command that under is this key and `view` means show view that is under this key

#### Example

```yml
default_view: "List functions"
views:
  "List functions":
    1:
      text: Next ðŸ‘‰
      view: "NPM functions"
    2:
      text: List
      command: ls
    3:
      text: One per line
      command: ll
    4:
      text: All files
      command: la
  "NPM functions":
    1:
      text: Next ðŸ‘‰
      view: "Git functions"
    2:
      text: NPM modules
